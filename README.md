# Brewers_Friend_Recipes_EDA_Active
In this repository you will find my first extended EDA in which I anylize the [Brewer's Friend Recipes](https://www.brewersfriend.com/search/) found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jtrofe/beer-recipes).

I'm currently working in this EDA but here is what has been done up to now.

Workflow:
1. First of all I commited to find what is the most efficient brewing method.
2. Then explored what is the most used brewing method.
3. After that, I tried to find a deeper reason why extract brewing method is used even with its low efficiency records. 

Findings:
1. Extract brewing is by far the less efficient method since steeping grains is only used for specialty malts; malt extract is used as the main fermentable object. Then extract method implies a waste in terms of efficiency because the sugar remaining in the wet steeped grain.
2. All grain method is the most used method. We consider that BIAB method is a particular case of an all grain method, so the former is included along with the later.
3. Exctract brewing method is broadly used for those high alcoholic beer recipes (Boil Gravity > 70) since these recipes represent the majority of the total where malt extract was used. Furthermore, these high alcoholic beers were brewed in small batches. This explains a lot since these recipes need a huge amount of grain in the all grain method, thus brewers prefer to use malt extract for the most of fermentables when their equipment is not big enough to hold the whole grain bed.
